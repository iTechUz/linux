## 🔷 Using the Shell

- **Shell** - On UNIX systems, from which Linux was derived, the program used to inter-
pret and manage commands was referred to as the **shell**.

- **shell** provides 
  - a way to create executable script files, 
  - run programs, work with filesystems, 
  - compile computer code, and manage the computer.

    ### 🔹 Using the shell prompt
      - the default prompt for a regular user is simply a dollar sign: - **$**
      - The default prompt for the **root** user is a pound sign (also called a number sign or a hash tag): - **#**

    ### 🔹 Using Shell Variables
      
      - **Environment variables** are variables that are exported to any new shells opened from the current shell. Type env to see environment variables.
      
      - You can refer to the value of any of those variables by preceding it with a dollar sign `($)` and placing it anywhere on a command line. For example: -  ` echo $USER`


    ### 🔹 Command-line completion
      - To save you a few keystrokes, the bash shell offers several different ways of **completing partially typed values**. 
      
      - To attempt to complete a value, type the first few characters and press **Tab**. Here are some of the values you can type partially from a bash shell: 
        
        - **Command, alias, or function** 
          - If the text you type begins with regular characters, the shell tries to complete the text with a command, alias, or function name.
        
        - **Variable** 
          - If the text you type begins with a dollar sign ($), the shell completes the text with a variable from the current shell.
        
        - **Username** 
          - If the text you type begins with a tilde (~), the shell completes the text with a username. As a result, `~username` indicates the home directory of the named user.
        
        - **Hostname** 
          - If the text you type begins with the at symbol `(@)`, the shell completes the text with a hostname taken from the `/etc/hosts` file.
